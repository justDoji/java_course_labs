Labs and solutions for the java course on my personal website

## How to

Import this project in your IDE. Don't care to much about the "gradle" stuff you see in the
project. This is only used to enable us to use certain functions from external libraries to write our tests.

The labs consist of tests and (usualy empty) classes. The code that should contain the logic is in the
'main' directory. The code containing the tests are in the 'test' directory.
The tests are used to check whether or not your solution is correct.

It is considered as a good practise to write a test before you start writing your code,
so you can see if you did the right thing fast.
In order to run your tests, open your test class, right click, and select "run tests".
Alternatively, in IntelliJ, you can use the hotkey 'ctrl + shift + F10' to run your tests.
